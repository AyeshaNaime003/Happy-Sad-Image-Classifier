# Happy-Sad-Image-Classifier


The project is based on Nicholas Renotte's video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jztwpsIzEGc). I highly recommend you check it out.

DATASET:
The dataset is a compilation of many datasets I found online; however, these dataset were small and herfore I had to make my own additions and also had to manuall remove unecessary images.I wpuld highly remcommend you to add your own images because at the moment one of the weakness of the models is that it has difficulty classifying images from the wild.

The entire project was done in google colab, therfore upload the resouces to google drive and mount the drive in google colab

Make necessary changes to the path. However keep the structure of data i.e data directory with subdirectories happy and sad, the same way. The images are extracted using the keras pipeline and thefore will appoint images of each subdirectory to different class.
